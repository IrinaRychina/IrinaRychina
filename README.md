Iâ€™m a Backend developer with 4 years of production experience. Currently, I'm working towards transitioning into a __data engineering role__. 

I'm pursuing this goal because I'm passionate about data. 

I love how data enables effective decision-making in business and in science. Itâ€™s fascinating to see how data helps uncover patterns, test hypotheses, and drive discoveries. I see data engineering as a way to contribute to meaningful progress by ensuring that reliable, well-organized data is available for those who need it, whether for analysis, innovation, or discovery.
